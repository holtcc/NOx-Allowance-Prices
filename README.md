Monthly NOx Allowance Prices 2014-2019 pulled from public EPA reports

EPA currently sets caps on NOx emissions in 22 states under the NAAQS using seasonal and annual budgets under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule. I pulled data from EPA's Power Sector Programs Progress Reports (see, e.g. https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/pdfs/2018_full_report.pdf,  https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html) and used Plot Digitizer (https://plotdigitizer.com/app) to transcribe the charts to an Excel document. I took monthly snapshots of seasonal and annual allowance prices for 2014-2019. Prices are approximate as they were visually transcribed from charts. Each data point represents the approximate price on the first of the month (note these are not monthly averages).
